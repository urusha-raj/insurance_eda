# Explortaory Data Analysis (EDA) on Insurance dataset
EDA on insurance dataset to uncover key patterns and relationships through univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. 

For univariate analysis, we examined the distributions of features such as gender, income group, education background, credit score, and annual mileage to understand the overall composition and variability within each attribute.

In bivariate analysis, we assessed pairwise relationships, such as the association between annual mileage and speeding violations, and explored correlations among variables like speeding violations, DUIs, and past accidents. We also compared mean annual mileage across different outcome categories, and analyzed average claim rates segmented by age groups and vehicle year categories. These comparisons help identify how two variables interact and whether specific groups are more likely to file claims.

For multivariate analysis, we investigated more complex interactions by examining how combinations of features—such as education and income, driving experience and marital status, and gender and family status—relate to the average claim rate. This approach reveals whether certain variable combinations heighten or reduce claim likelihood, offering valuable insight for risk assessment and insurance modeling.
